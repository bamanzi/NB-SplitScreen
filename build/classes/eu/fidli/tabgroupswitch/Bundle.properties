OpenIDE-Module-Long-Description=This allows you to use split screen conveniently. <br/>\n<br/>\nThis plugin is just two changeable shortcuts.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne cycles through all opened document tab groups, switching active file, therefore the cursor (caret, insertion point). <br/>\nSecond moves the active opened file into the next tab group, allowing you to move opened files without touching the mouse...<br/>\n<br/>\nYou can change these shortcuts in Options > Keymap. <br/>\nActions can also be found under Navigate > Go to next tab group <br/>\n                                                    and Window > Dock current file into next tab group<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease, feel free to request future requests or ask any questions.<br/>\n<br/>\nAuthor: Adam Kubista, kubistaa@gmail.com
